# AI-Powered Enhanced EHR Imaging & Documentation System

**Project Status:**(In Development)

## Project Overview

This project is dedicated to significantly enhancing **Electronic Health Records (EHR)** by integrating **Generative AI (GenAI)** capabilities.The primary goal is to improve the quality of patient care and clinician efficiency by automating administrative tasks and improving diagnostic tools.

## Project Goals

The core aims of this initiative are twofold:
1. **Enhance Medical Imaging:** Utilize GenAI to improve the clarity, interpretability, and reconstruction of medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRIs, CTs).
2. **Automate Clinical Documentation:** Automate routine administrative tasks, including clinical documentation and **ICD-10 coding**.

These enhancements are designed to minimize the time clinicians spend on non-clinical tasks, supporting **faster, more accurate decision-making**.The GenAI-driven components will be powered by **Azure OpenAI**.

## Expected Outcomes

Upon successful implementation, the project is expected to deliver the following key benefits:

* **Improved Diagnosis:** Enhanced interpretation of medical images through AI-driven enhancement and reconstruction.
* **Reduced Administrative Burden:** A significant reduction in time spent on documentation through automated clinical note generation.
* **Streamlined Workflows:** Seamless integration of automated ICD-10 coding directly into clinical workflows.
* **Enhanced Patient Care:** Greater clinician focus on patient care by minimizing repetitive administrative efforts.

## Implementation Modules

The project is structured into four distinct modules to manage development and integration systematically:

### Module 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing
* **Objective:** Prepare imaging and clinical data to ensure readiness for AI model training and application.
* **Key Tasks:**
    * Collect diverse medical imaging datasets (X-ray, MRI, CT, ultrasound, DXA).
    * Gather structured and unstructured EHR content, including patient notes and coding data.
    * Clean, label, and standardize all data for compatibility with GenAI models.

### Module 2: Medical Imaging Enhancement
* **Objective:** Employ GenAI to enhance image quality and provide better support for diagnosis.
* **Key Tasks:**
    * Apply GenAI for denoising and realistic reconstruction of medical images.
    * Improve image resolution and clarity to support better visualization for clinicians.
    * Train image enhancement models using Azure OpenAI tools.

### Module 3: Clinical Note Generation & ICD-10 Coding Automation
* **Objective:** Automate routine documentation and coding tasks using Generative AI.
* **Key Tasks:**
    * Generate clinical notes based on structured data and doctor observations.
    * Automate ICD-10 coding by mapping EHR input to standard classifications.
    * Decrease documentation workload through seamless integration of GenAI tools.

### Module 4: Integration and Deployment
* **Objective:** Successfully deploy and integrate the enhanced EHR features into live clinical environments.
* **Key Tasks:**
    * Deploy trained GenAI models into real-time clinical workflows.
    * Integrate the solution with existing hospital EHR systems for image processing and note generation.
    * Provide necessary onboarding and training sessions for medical staff to ensure effective use of the new tools.
